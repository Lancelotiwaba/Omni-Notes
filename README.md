Notes Pro From Omni-Notes

Note taking <b>open-source</b> application aimed to have both a <b>simple interface</b> but keeping <b>smart</b> behavior.

The project was inspired by the absence of such applications compatible with old phones and old versions of Android. It aims to provide an attractive look and follow the most recent design guidelines of the Google operating system.

## Contributing

Due to the fact that I'm using [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) as code versioning methodology, you as developer should **always** start working on [develop branch](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/tree/develop) that contains the most recent changes.

There are many features/improvements that are not on **my** roadmap but someone else could decide to work on them anyway: hunt for issues tagged as [Help Wanted](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=label%3A"Help+wanted") to find them!

Feel free to add yourself to [contributors.md](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/blob/develop/contributors.md) file.

**Don't forget to contribute to original code! Don't be selfish or lazy!**

### Test code contributions

All code changes and additions **must** be tested.
See the [related section](#test) about this.

### Fork project

When forking the project you'll have to modify some files that are strictly dependent from my own development / build / third-party-services environment. Files that need some attention are the following:

- *gradle.properties*: this is overridden by another file with the same name inside the *omniNotes* module. You can do the same or leave as it is, any missing property will let the app gracefully fallback on a default behavior.
- *.travis.yml*: if you use [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) as continuous integration platform and a SonarQUBE instance for code quality analysis you'll have to modify this file according to your needs.
